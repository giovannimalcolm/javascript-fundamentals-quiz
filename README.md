# javascript-fundamentals-quiz

A short Javscript fundamentals quiz application. Users are greeted by a homepage with title, description of the quiz rules, link to an unsorted scoreboard (local device scores), the initial timer count, and a start game button. 
Upon starting the game the user is presented with the first question and the other three upon each answer. The user answers by simply clicking on an answer choice. A message is declared indicating the user if they answered correctly or not. Time is deducted by 10 seconds for each wrong answer. 
The game is over when the timer runs out or when all questions are answered. When the game is over, the user will be shown their final score and prompted to submit their name to post their score on the scoreboard. If the user does not enter a name their score will not be posted.
The scoreboard can be cleared on the scoreboard page './highscores.html' upon clicking the "Clear Scores" button. 
The game can be restarted by clicked on the "Play again" link. 

The application can be found at: https://giovannimalcolm.github.io/javascript-fundamentals quiz/
